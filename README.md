# microshell
Pointless microshell but with good "sl"

Available commends:
- cp [from] [destination]
- exit
- cd [folder] | "-" moves you back to last folder, with no arguments goes to home
- echo [color] [text] | help echo for list of colors
- ls [folder] | no folder = current folder, optional flag -l
- find [optional folder] [file]
- rm [file]
- cat [file] | cat > [new_file] << [EOF]
- help but it's in polish
- clear
- history
- giga/sl (honestly the only useful part of this project)
